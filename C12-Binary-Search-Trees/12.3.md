### Exercises 12.3-2
***
Suppose that a binary search tree is constructed by repeatedly inserting distinct values into the tree. Argue that the number of nodes examined in searching for a value in the tree is one plus the number of nodes examined when the value was first inserted into the tree.

### `Answer`
多检查一次是否相等.

We should check one more time of this node, obviously.

### Exercises 12.3-3
***
We can sort a given set of n numbers by first building a binary search tree containing these numbers (using TREE-INSERT repeatedly to insert the numbers one by one) and then printing the numbers by an inorder tree walk. What are the worst-case and best-case running times for this sorting algorithm?

### `Answer`
退化成链表就是最坏情况.

If it's Degenerated into a list, then the worst situation.

### Exercises 12.3-4
***
Is the operation of deletion "commutative" in the sense that deleting x and then y from a binary search tree leaves the same tree as deleting y and then x? Argue why it is or give a counterexample.

### `Answer`
NO.

### Exercises 12.3-5
***
Suppose that instead of each node x keeping the attribute x:p, pointing to x’s parent, it keeps x:succ, pointing to x’s successor. Give pseudocode for SEARCH, INSERT, and DELETE on a binary search tree T using this representation. These procedures should operate in time O.h/, where h is the height of the tree T . (Hint: You may wish to implement a subroutine that returns the parent of a node.)
### `Answer`
问题的关键是从successor得到parent，同时复杂度在O(h)内。所以分以下的情况讨论。
case 1. x == x.parent.left; 令m是以x为根的子树中的最大值，则显然 m.successor = x.parent.
        a. x 没有right child，则m = x, x.parent = x.successor;
        b. x 有right child, 则m = Max(x.right), x.parent = m.successor;
case 2. x == x.parent.right; 令m是以x为根的子树中的最大值, 令 n = m.successor, 则m.predecessor = n. 现在考虑m在寻找
        predecessor的过程，则m会先访问其左子树，然后一直向右子树迭代。故这条path中，必然会经过x 和 x.parent.

### Exercises 12.3-6
***
When node z in TREE-DELETE has two children, we could splice out its predecessor rather than its successor. Some have argued that a fair strategy, giving equal priority to predecessor and successor, yields better empirical performance. How might TREE-DELETE be changed to implement such a fair strategy?

### `Answer`

* Randomly choose one
* Assign each node with an attribute **height**, choose the higher one.
