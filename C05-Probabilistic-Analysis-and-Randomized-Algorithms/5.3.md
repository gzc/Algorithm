### Exercises 5.3-1
***
Professor Marceau objects to the loop invariant used in the proof of Lemma 5.5. He questions whether it is true prior to the first iteration. His reasoning is that one could just as easily declare that an empty subarray contains no 0-permutations. Therefore, the probability that an empty subarray contains a 0-permutation should be 0, thus invalidating the loop invariant prior to the first iteration. Rewrite the procedure RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE so that its associated loop invariant applies to a nonempty subarray prior to the first iteration, and modify the proof of Lemma 5.5 for your procedure.


### `Answer`

We can redefine the algo in a very simple way that we do not have to deal with 0-permutation of n array at all and then leave
no iota of doubt for professor Marceau.

    RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE(A)
        n = A.legth
	if n == 1
	    return
	else
	    swap A[1] with RANDOM(1, n)
	    for i = 2 to n
	        swap A[i] with RANDOM(i, n)
		

And now we can use the same loop invarient that was used earlier.


### Exercises 5.3-2
***
Professor Kelp decides to write a procedure that will produce at random any permutation besides the identity permutation. He proposes the following procedure:

	PERMUTE-WITHOUT-IDENTITY(A)
	1 n ← length[A]
	2 for i ← 1 to n	
	3 	do swap A[i] ↔ A[RANDOM(i + 1, n)]

	
Does this code do what Professor Kelp intends?

### `Answer`
没有，因为[1,3,2...]这样的序列虽然不是identity permutation但是却不会产生.

### Exercises 5.3-3
***
Suppose that instead of swapping element A[i] with a random element from the subarray A[i .. n], we swapped it with a random element from anywhere in the array:
￼

	PERMUTE-WITH-ALL(A)
	1 n ← length[A]
	2 for i ← 1 to n
	3 	do swap A[i] ↔ A[RANDOM(1, n)]

Does this code produce a uniform random permutation? Why or why not?

### `Answer`
No, because there are already n! sorts of arrangements, but this practice has n choices for each iteration, so there are n^n choices. And n^n cannot be divisible by n!, so it is not uniform.

Second explaination.

PERMUTE-WITH-ALL might produce k-permutation where k < n; That is it might produce an n permutation where you might have some duplicates.

### Exercises 5.3-4
***
Professor Armstrong suggests the following procedure for generating a uniform random permutation:

	PERMUTE-BY-CYCLIC(A)
	1 n ← length[A]
	2 offset ← RANDOM(1, n)
	3 for i <- i to n
	4 	do dest <- i + offset
	5		if dest > n
	6			then dest <- dest-n
	7		B[dest] -< A[i]
	8	return B
	

Show that each element A[i] has a 1/n probability of winding up in any particular position in B. Then show that Professor Armstrong is mistaken by showing that the resulting permutation is not uniformly random.

### `Answer`
这个算法对于给定的offset,只会产生一种排列...也就是最后只有n种排列而不是n!种. 只会将原数组**平移**，谈不上**随机**.

### Exercises 5.3-5

Prove that in the array P in procedure PERMUTE-BY-SORTING, the probability that all

### Exercises 5.3-6
***
Explain how to implement the algorithm PERMUTE-BY-SORTING to handle the case in which two or more priorities are identical. That is, your algorithm should produce a uniform random permutation, even if two or more priorities are identical.

### `Answer`

#### Approach 1

    PERMUTE-BY-SORTING(A)
        n = A.length
	let P[1..n] be a new array
	for i = 1 to n
	    P[i] = RANDOM(1, n^3)
	
	let k = -1
	do
	    k = CONTAINS-DUPLICATE(P)
	    if k > 0
	        P[k] = RANDOM(1, n^3]
	    else 
	        k = -1
	while (k != -1)
	sort A, using P as sort keys

#### Approach 2

    PERMUTE-BY-SORTING(A)
        n = A.length
	let P[1..n] be a new array
	for i = 1 to n
	    m = RANDOM(1, n^3)
	    if P contains m
	        i = i - 1;
	    else 
	        P[i] = m
	sort A, using P as sort keys
