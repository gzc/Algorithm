### Exercises 22.1-3
***
The **transpose** of a directed graph G = (V, E) is the graph G**T** = (V, E**T**), where E**T** = {(v, u) in V × V : (u, v) in E}. Thus, G**T** is G with all its edges reversed. Describe efficient algorithms for computing G**T** from G, for both the adjacency-list and adjacency-matrix representations of G. Analyze the running times of your algorithms.

**T** means transpose.

* adjacency-list : 遍历所有的节点,对某个节点i,遍历其Adj,将i这个节点增加到Adj中遇到的每个点的Adj中. 需要的时间是O(V+E). <br /> Iterate all the nodes, for each node **i**, mark its adjacency-list as **L**, then add **i** to all the nodes in L.

* adjacency-matrix : 对称矩阵， 在邻接矩阵中(u, v) 和（v， u）都一样 <br /> Just transpose the matrix
				

### Exercises 22.1-4
***
Given an adjacency-list representation of a multigraph G = (V, E), describe an O(V + E)-time algorithm to compute the adjacency-list representation of the "equivalent" undirected graph G′ = (V, E′), where E′ consists of the edges in E with all multiple edges between two vertices replaced by a single edge and with all self-loops removed.

### `Answer`
* We iterate through all the vertices in the multigraph.
* For each of the vertices we iterate through their multigraph adjacency list.
* While iterating through the multigraph adjacency list of a vertex u, we add the neighbor to the new adjacency list of u and u to the new adjacency list of the neighbor, if the neighbor is not vertex u itself and if the neighbor is not already present in the new adjacency list of u.
* The new adjacency list array is a representation of the required undirected graph.

The **square** of a directed graph G=(V,E) is the graph G2 =(V,E2) such that (u,w) in E2 if  and only if for some v in V, both(u,v) in E and(v,w) in E.That is,G2 contains an edge between u and w whenever G contains a path with exactly two edges between u and w.

### `Answer`

使用原来的方法O(V+E)时间创建邻接矩阵, 行表示出发点， 列表示到达点， 然后，对于每一个顶点v， 看有哪一些值是1的， 在去那些 1 对应的的顶点的列向量中，查找那些为 1 的点（出了自身）， 就是1，2步可以到达的顶点，查找时间为 V * (V-i) * (V-i), i为已经检查过的点 ,时间复杂度为 O(V^3)
```c++
for i = 1 to n
    for j = 1 to n
        if G[i][j] == 1
            G2[i][j] = 1
        else
            for k = 1 to n
                if G[i][k] == 1 and G[k][j] == 1
                    G2[i][j] = 1
                else
                    G2[i][j] = 0
```

假设有向图的邻接矩阵中， E(u, v)存在的时候， AdjMatrix[u][v]=1, AdjMatrix[v][u] = -1; 这种记录表式方式
以7个元素的邻接矩阵为例， 从右下角开始向左检索， （7，7）跳过， （7， 6） == 1表示7指向6，也就是7不是通用汇点， 那就向上一行， 到达第6行， 同理跳过(6.6)， 然后检查(6, 5), (6, 5) == -1, 也就是5指向6， 所以继续检查(6,4),， 一共检查了7次之后， 假设剩下的点是v， 那么去检查AdjMatrix的第v行， 看是不是全是 -1， 一共检查了 7 * 2 = 14次， N哥顶点， O(2N) = O(N)

### Exercises 22.1-7
***
The incidence matrix of a directed graph G = (V, E) is a |V| × |E| matrix B = (bij) such that

			-1		if edge j leaves vertex i
	bij =   1		if edge j enters vertex i
   			0		otherwise
   			
Describe what the entries of the matrix product B BT represent, where BT is the transpose of B.

T means transpose

### `Answer`
Assume we have a simple graph with 3 vertex {X,Y,Z} and two edges{X->Y,X->Z}.

The incidence matrix B for the above graph is as follows.

			   XY    XZ	
		  X    -1    -1
	B =   Y     1     0
		  Z     0     1
		  
The matrix BT is as follows.

         		X    Y    Z
	BT = XY    -1    1    0
	     XZ    -1    0    1
	     
The matrix product BBT is as follows.

				X	Y	Z
			X	2	-1	-1
	BBT =   Y	-1	1	0
            Z	-1	0	1


	BBT(u,v) = degree of u = indegree + outdegree if u = v
				−(number of edges connecting u and v) if u != v

### Exercises 22.1-8
***
Suppose that instead of a linked list, each array entry Adj[u] is a hash table containing the vertices v for which (u, v) in E. If all edge lookups are equally likely, what is the expected time to determine whether an edge is in the graph? What disadvantages does this scheme have? Suggest an alternate data structure for each edge list that solves these problems. Does your alternative have disadvantages compared to the hash table?

### `Answer`
[reference](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9667571/graph-what-are-the-disadvantages-if-i-replace-each-linked-list-in-adjacency-li)

I think the expected time is O(1), because I just go Hashtable t = Adj[u], then return t.get(v);

I think the disadvantage is that Hashtable will take more spaces then linked list.


It could be a binary search tree.

In an adjacency matrix, each vertex is followed by an array of V elements. This O(V)-space cost leads to fast (O(1)-time) searching of edges.

In an adjacency list, each vertex is followed by a list, which contains only the n adjacent vertices. This space-efficient way leads to slow searching (O(n)).

A hash table is a compromise between the array and the list. It uses less space than V, but requires the handle of collisions in searching.

A binary search tree is another compromise -- the space cost is minimum as that of lists, and the time cost in searching is O(lg n).

Disadvantage for BST could be that search/insert/delete operations all need O(lgn) time, while those operations for hash table is O(1) time.
