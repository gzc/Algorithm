### Exercises 6.1-1
***
What are the minimum and maximum numbers of elements in a heap of height h?

### `Answer`
最多就是一颗很完美的二叉树,是2^(h+1) − 1 ; 最少的话最后一层只有一个,是2^h

What it is a perfect complete tree, it is 2^(h+1) - 1; when the last level has only one element, we have 2^h.

### Exercises 6.1-2
***
Show that an n-element heap has height ⌞lg n⌟

### `Answer`
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%202^{h+1}-1\\geq%20x%20\\geq%202^{h}%20\\rightrightarrows%20%20\\lg{x}%20\\geq%20h%20\\geq%20\\lg\(x+1\)-1%20)

所以h = ⌞lg n⌟

### Exercises 6.1-3
***
Show that in any subtree of a max-heap, the root of the subtree contains the largest value occurring anywhere in that subtree.

### `Answer`
这就是最大堆的性质.

This is the property of maximum heap.

### Exercises 6.1-4
***
Where in a max-heap might the smallest element reside, assuming that all elements are distinct?

### `Answer`
It must be in the leaf node.

### Exercises 6.1-5
***
Is an array that is in sorted order a min-heap?

### `Answer`
如果假设按排序排序，则排序顺序是递增的，那么是的，因为对于被视为父节点的任何索引i，左子级子由（2 * i）给出，右子级子由（2 * i）给出+1。在排序数组中，这两个索引都将在父节点的右侧，因此更大或相等。因此，这满足了Heap属性，可以认为是最小堆.

If you assume by sorted, that it is in increasing sorted order, then yes, because for any index i considered as a parent node, the left subchild is given by (2*i) and right subchild is given by (2*i)+1. In a sorted array, both these indices will be to the right of the parent node and therefore larger or equal. Therefore this satisfies the Heap property and it can be considered a min-heap.

### Exercises 6.1-6
***
Is the sequence [23, 17, 14, 6, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12] a max-heap?

### `Answer`
NO, because 7 > 6

### Exercises 6.1-7
***
Show that, with the array representation for storing an n-element heap, the leaves are the nodes indexed by ⌞n/2⌟ + 1, ⌞n/2⌟ + 2, ... , n.

### `Answer`
挺容易推的，因为每增加两个节点，树的叶子节点就会往后推移一位.再注意一下取整的位置就行.

It is easy to conclude, every time we add two nodes, the index of leaf nodes will increase 1.
